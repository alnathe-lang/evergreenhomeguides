# How to Prepare Your Roof for Hurricane Season in NE Florida

Hurricane season brings high winds, driving rain, and unpredictable damage to Florida homes. Your roof is your first line of defense. Preparing now can save thousands of dollars in repairs later.

## 1. Inspect Your Roof Early
- Look for cracked or missing shingles/tiles  
- Check flashing around chimneys and vents

## 2. Clean Gutters and Downspouts
Clogged gutters force water back under shingles. Make sure all downspouts direct water at least 6 feet from your foundation.

---

## 3. Trim Trees and Secure the Yard
Remove overhanging branches and tie down outdoor furniture. Anything that can fly can damage your home.

---

## 4. Document with Photos
Take clear pictures of your roof and exterior before storm season. These will help with insurance claims if damage occurs.
